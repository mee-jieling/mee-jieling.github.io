## 👨‍💼 BIO

I obtained my B.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the School of Power and Mechanical Engineering, [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), China, in 2012 and 2018, respectively. During Aug. to Nov. in the year of 2017, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Department of Automatic Control and Micro-Mechatronic Systems, [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr/en), France. From Jan. 2019 to Jan. 2020, I served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/). From Dec. 2024 to Dec. 2025, I was a visiting scholar in Laboratoire Génie de Production, [University of Technologie Tarbes Occitanie Pyrénées (UTTOP)](https://www.uttop.fr/en/index.html), University of Toulouse alliance, France. Since August 2020, I have been an Associate Professor at the College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](https://en.nuaa.edu.cn/) (Project 211 and the Double First-Class Construction University in China). From May. 2025, I have been selected as the Ph.D. Supervisor in NUAA.

## 📢 News

- **[2026-02-18]** 🌍 **Invited Winter School Talk**

-   I was honored to deliver a lecture titled "Design and Control of Piezoelectric Actuators in Aerospace Applications" at the Winter School on "Introduction to Piezoelectric Mechatronics" , organized by Prof. Micky Rakotondrabe at the University of Technology Tarbes Occitanie Pyrénées (UTTOP) , France. The talk introduced our recent research at NUAA on piezoelectric stack pumps for electro-hydrostatic actuators, bimorph actuators for high-speed servo valves, and distributed stack actuators with fault-tolerant control—topics addressing the aerospace demands for high power-to-weight ratio, fast response, and enhanced reliability. This visit also continued my long-term collaboration with French institutions, following my previous stays at FEMTO-ST Institute in 2017 and at UTTOP as a visiting scholar from 2024 to 2025. Grateful to Prof. Rakotondrabe for the invitation and to all the participants for the engaging discussions!

- **[2025-12-13]** 📢 **Winter School 2026 — Introduction to Piezoelectric Mechatronics**

  Prof. **Micky Rakotondrabe** is organizing a Winter School on *“Introduction to Piezoelectric Mechatronics”*, which will take place on **February 16–20, 2026** at the **University of Technology of Tarbes (UTTOP)**, Tarbes, France.  
  More information is available at: [http://rakoton.net/Schools/PiezoMechatronics/](http://rakoton.net/Schools/PiezoMechatronics/)

  This winter school aims to introduce piezoelectric mechatronic systems, from fundamental piezoelectric principles to advanced system modeling and control. The program includes lectures, tutorials, and application-oriented examples, with the final day dedicated to a social event.

  The school is mainly intended for MSc and PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and young researchers working on or interested in smart material–based systems, especially piezoelectric systems. Engineers and researchers wishing to discover this field are also welcome.

  The registration process consists of two steps: **preregistration (currently open)** and registration payment.

  Please see the following page for the process: [http://rakoton.net/Schools/PiezoMechatronics/registration.php](http://rakoton.net/Schools/PiezoMechatronics/registration.php)
  
  Both preregistration and registration close on **February 1, 2026**. Winter School period: February 16-20, 2026.

- **[2025-08-27]** 🏆 Our research group has been granted a National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Project titled "Research on a Distally Extensible Bronchoscopic Robot for Peripheral Lung Nodule Biopsy". The funding rate this year is 12.26%. Traditional bronchoscopes are limited by their structural size and turning ability, making it difficult to reach the peripheral lung for biopsy operations. This project aims to achieve innovation in structure, modeling theory, and control methods to develop an end-extensible bronchoscope robot for peripheral pulmonary nodule biopsy.

- **[2025-08-22]** 🎉 A paper by an undergraduate student group has been **Accepted** for publication in [Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanismsrobotics). This work was funded by College Students' Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program‌ in NUAA. Robotic-assisted lumbar puncture (LP) has demonstrated significant advantages over manual
procedures in terms of accuracy and repeatability, with robotic-assisted needle insertion devices (RNIDs) serving as the core component for accurate needle placement. This paper proposes a one degree of freedom (1-DOF) patient-specific RNID to enhance the insertion accuracy.
